# **Bilinear Interpolation Image Resizing in Python**

This repository contains a Python exercise that focuses on image resizing using the bilinear interpolation algorithm. Bilinear interpolation is a mathematical technique commonly used in computer graphics to resize images while maintaining smooth and visually pleasing results.

## Overview

Image resizing is a fundamental task in image processing and computer vision. Bilinear interpolation is an interpolation technique that takes into account the
weighted average of four neighboring pixels to estimate the color values of new pixels during resizing. This approach helps in preserving the overall structure and 
details of the original image.

In this exercise, you will find a Python script that demonstrates the implementation of the mathematical algorithm of bilinear interpolation for image resizing.
The provided script allows you to:

- Load an input image.
- Specify the target dimensions for resizing.
- Perform bilinear interpolation to resize the image.
- Save the resized image.
